A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet.  From mid-morning through late afternoon, light freezing rain fell along the coast with a mixture of freezing rain and sleet inland, except for just snow across Western Orange County.  As the low approached Long Island, bands of moderate to heavy precipitation rotated northwest around the low.  Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.  Bands of heavy snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City, and Western Nassau County during the evening.

Manhattan:  from 5.5 inches at Central Park to 6 inches at Columbia University.

A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.

A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet.  From mid-morning through late afternoon, light freezing rain fell along the coast with a mixture of freezing rain and sleet inland, except for just snow across Western Orange County.  As the low approached Long Island, bands of moderate to heavy precipitation rotated northwest around the low.  Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.  Bands of heavy snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City, and Western Nassau County during the evening.

With cold air in place, as a warm front approached from the south and a weak low pressure system moved northeast along the coast, light snow developed from around 6:40 am at Westchester County Airport to 10:45 am at Westhampton Beach (in Suffolk County).  Snowfall became heavy, falling at the rate of at least 1 inch per hour from around 10 am across the entire area until around 4 pm across Orange and Putnam Counties. Snow changed to freezing rain from around 2:30 pm along the south shore of Long Island to around 7 pm across Orange County.

Snowfall amounts ranged from 1 to 2 inches along the south shores of Long Island, 3 to 4 inches across the north shores of Long Island and New York City to 6 inches across the Lower Hudson Valley.  This first round of heavy precipitation was followed by up to a 1/8th-inch thick ice coating, which caused serious and widespread traffic disruptions.

Here are selected snowfall amounts:

For Orange County:  from 5.5 inches at Middletown, Walden, and Greenwood Lake to 6.5 inches at Montgomery.

For Putnam County:  from 3 inches at Lake Carmel to 6 inches at Croton Falls.

For Westchester County:  from 2 inches at Yonkers to 6 inches at White Plains.

For New York (Manhattan) County:  from 3 inches at Central Park to 3.8 inches at Columbia University.

For Queens County:  from 2 inches at JFK Airport to 3 inches at LGA Airport.

A second low pressure system moved east from Pennsylvania, and passed "just" south of Long Island overnight.  This low produced freezing rain across the region.

As a result, ice jams developed on the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. During the night of Feburary 27 and 28, rainfall  accumulated between one half and one inch and a half across eastern New York. The rains exacerbated the runoff, which resulted in the flooding of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, as well as some smaller streams. Most of the flooding was minor. 
	The Mohawk River exceeded bankful between Utica and Cohoes. The gage at Utica exceeded its flood stage of 403  feet on Feburary 27, crested at 406.4 feet on the 28th, and remained  over  the flood stage for the remainder of the month. At Little Falls, the river went three tenths of a foot  above the 15 foot flood stage. At Cohoes, the river rose two tenths of a foot over the 20 foot stage. The river flooded mainly adjacent lowlands from Utica to Halfmoon. However, forty people were evacuated from their homes in Halfmoon as water encroached upon their homes. Water from the Mohawk overflowed onto a small portion of Route 162 in Montgomery county near Canajoharie and Root, resulting in the roadway being temporarily closed. Flooding was noted along the Hudson-Mohawk bikeway, Canal road, Beach road, Towpath road as well as the parking lot of Schenectady Community College. Fifty residences were evacuated in the Crescent area of southern Saratoga county, some by boat. A few residences were also evacuated on Schaffer drive in Colonie, Albany county.  
	The Hudson River overflowed onto the Mechanicville Wharf and also went over the Mohawk Wharf into the village of Waterford. The village of Warrensburg reported some localized flooding as did the Stillwater Flats.  However, no gages on the Hudson exceeded  their flood stages. 
	The Gilboa Dam barely exceeded its limit of 1132 feet. Excessive water had to be released, which resulted in the Schoharie creek overflowing into Lost Valley and near Burtonsville. 
	The Mettawee river in Washington county crested at 8.7 feet, well over its 7 foot flood stage at Granville. Water from the river inundated several homes in Granville and flooded several roads.
	The Moose River exceeded its 12 foot flood stage at McKeever by four  tenths of one foot. No flooding problems were reported to the National Weather Service.

Water from the Mohawk overflowed onto a small portion of Route 162 in Montgomery county near Canajoharie and Root, resulting in the roadway being temporarily closed. Flooding was noted along the Hudson-Mohawk bikeway, Canal road, Beach road, Towpath road as well as the parking lot of Schenectady Community College.
